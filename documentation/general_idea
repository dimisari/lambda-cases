Everything is a value with:
- a name
- a type
- an expression


For example the "Hello World!" program is

main: Program
  = print("Hello World!")

the name is "main"
the type is "Program"
the expression is "print(\"Hello World!\")"


On the other hand n is

n : Integer
  = 42

the name is "n"
the type is "Integer"
the expression is "42"


And the radius of a circle is

area_of_circle_with_radius(_) : (@A)CanBeReal --> @A => Real
  = radius => pi*real(radius)^2

the name is "area_of_circle_with_radius(_)"
the type is "(@A)CanBeReal --> @A => Real"
the expression is "radius => pi*real(radius)^2"

where

real(_) : (@A)CanBeReal --> @A => Real


The actual value is the evaluation of the written expression which is also an
expression. This expression is derived from the written one by applying
rewriting rules or evaluating arithmetic expressions. When no further rewriting
rules are possible, the evaluation is complete and the final expression (the
value) is said to be in normal form.


For example we have circle42 where

circle42 : Real
  = area_of_circle_with_radius(n)

we have the following rewrites

"area_of_circle_with_radius(n)" ->
substitute "42" for "n" -> "area_of_circle_with_radius(42)" ->
apply "radius => pi*real(radius)^2" to "42" -> "pi*real(42)^2" ->
apply "real(_)" to "42" -> "pi*42.^2" ->
evaluate "42.^2" -> "pi*1764"
evaluate "pi*1764" -> "5541.7694409324"


and there are also rewrites for type checking

check if "Integer" is valid argument of "(@A)CanBeReal --> @A => Real"
-->
the argument is of type "Integer" and the parameter of type "@A" so for the
types to check we need "@A = Integer". Because (Integer)CanBeReal is a
condition which is satisfied and so we can substitute "Integer" for "@A" and
"Integer" is valid argument of "Integer => Real"
-->
The resulting type is "Real"

which means that circle42 is correctly annotated as "Real"
