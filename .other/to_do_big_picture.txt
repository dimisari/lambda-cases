- repl
- imports
- package manager

It seems like it should be an interpreter in order for the code to be the
program. Otherwise, the executable is the program. This introduces too many
complexities for my humble mind to be able to wrap itself around.

All imports should have some kind of hash output attached for full
compatibility and all software writers should accordingly release their
software with hash outputs instead of versions.
